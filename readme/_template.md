# 👋 Hi! I'm Michael.

> AKA: The Bald Bearded Builder

I've been a developer since... well, we didn't have CSS and no one was sure if JavaScript or VBScript was going to win the browser wars.

After years of building and leading developers, I now spend my days creating workshops, live streams, demos and other content to help developers learn new skills and level up their careers.

Here's a few of my recent ramblings:
