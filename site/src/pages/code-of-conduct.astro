        The Bald Bearded Builder community is filled with amazing, clever and
        creative people, and we're excited for you to join us. Our goal is to
        create spaces where people can gather and discuss important themes and
        feelings that many of us will experience during our technical career.
      </p>

      <h2 id="being-a-good-community-member">Being a Good Community Member</h2>
      <p>
        Yes, there are things we don't want you to do in our community — and
        we'll get to those. But first we'd like to talk about things we do want
        folks to do. These are ways you can be a positive member of the Bald
        Bearded Builder community.
      </p>
      <p>
        Please begin by thinking carefully about and agreeing with the following
        statements:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          I will be welcoming to everyone at the table, and patient with
          newcomers
        </li>
        <li>I will treat everyone with respect, because they deserve it</li>
        <li>I will be mindful of the needs and boundaries of others</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        Here are a few other key things you can do to make the community great:
      </p>

      <h3 id="be-humble">BE HUMBLE</h3>
      <p>
        People come from all different places, and it's best not to make
        assumptions about what they think or feel. Approach others with
        curiosity. We all have a lot to learn from each other.
      </p>

      <h3 id="be-helpful-when-asked">BE HELPFUL WHEN ASKED</h3>
      <p>
        If someone asks for help, consider jumping in to point them in the right
        direction.
      </p>

      <h3 id="encourage-others">ENCOURAGE OTHERS</h3>
      <p>
        There's no one path to have a career in technology. Instead of shooting
        down other people's ideas, try to engage them in ways that create
        opportunities for learning and fun.
      </p>

      <h2 id="code-of-conduct">Code of Conduct</h2>
      <p>
        We ask everyone who participates in our community upholds their ideals.
        By vowing to follow these guidelines, you will help create a welcoming
        and friendly community based on respect and trust.
      </p>
      <p>
        We are committed to creating a harassment-free community. These rules
        will be strictly enforced in any and all of our official spaces, like
        our Discord server, Twitch chat and physical events, and everyone who
        participates in these spaces is required to agree to this community
        code. We have zero-tolerance for harassment, and anybody who engages in
        the following behaviors may be banned without warning. We also ask and
        expect community members to observe these rules anywhere the community
        is meeting (for example, online chats in unofficial platforms or event
        after-parties).
      </p>

      <h3 id="be-respectful">BE RESPECTFUL</h3>
      <p>
        Don't make offensive comments related to gender, gender identity and
        expression, sexual orientation, disability, mental illness,
        neuro(a)typicality, physical appearance, body size, race, immigration
        status, religion, or other identity markers.
      </p>
      <p>
        Additionally, don't insult or demean others. This includes making
        unwelcome comments about a person's lifestyle choices and practices,
        including things related to diet, health, parenting, drugs, or
        employment. It's not okay to insult or demean others if it's "just a
        joke."
      </p>

      <h3 id="be-welcoming-and-open">BE WELCOMING AND OPEN</h3>
      <p>
        Don't engage in gatekeeping behaviors, like questioning the intelligence
        or knowledge of others as a way to prove their credentials. And don't
        exclude people for prejudicial reasons.
      </p>

      <h3 id="respect-privacy">RESPECT PRIVACY</h3>
      <p>
        Do not publish private communications without consent. Additionally,
        never "out" private aspects of a person's personal identity without
        consent, except as necessary to protect them from intentional abuse.
      </p>

      <h3 id="respect-personal-boundries">RESPECT PERSONAL BOUNDARIES</h3>
      <p>
        Do not introduce gratuitous or off-topic sexual images, languages, or
        behavior in spaces where they are not appropriate. Never make physical
        contact or simulated physical contact without consent or after a request
        to stop. Additionally, do not continue to message others about anything
        if they ask you to stop or leave them alone.
      </p>

      <h3 id="be-a-good-neighbor">BE A GOOD NEIGHBOR</h3>
      <p>
        Do not make threats of violence, intimidate others, incite violence or
        intimidation against others, incite self-harm, stalk, follow, or
        otherwise harass others.
      </p>

      <h2 id="rules-for-online-spaces">Rules for online spaces</h2>
      <p>
        For Bald Bearded Builder' official online spaces, like our Twitch chat
        and community Discord channel, we have some additional rules. Any of the
        following behaviors can result in a ban without warning.
      </p>

      <h3 id="dont-spam">DON'T SPAM</h3>
      <p>Don't spam. We'll ban you.</p>

      <h3 id="keep-it-legal">KEEP IT LEGAL</h3>
      <p>
        If it's illegal, it's not allowed on our websites or in our online
        spaces. Please don't share links to pirated material or other nefarious
        things.
      </p>

      <h3 id="no-trolling">NO TROLLING</h3>
      <p>
        Please be earnest. Don't use excessive sarcasm to annoy or undermine
        other people. And don't bait them with bad faith comments or abuse.
      </p>

      <h3 id="pornography-and-other-nsfw-stuff">
        PORNOGRAPHY AND OTHER NSFW STUFF
      </h3>
      <p>
        Please don't post it or link to it. It doesn't belong in our online
        spaces.
      </p>

      <h3 id="foul-and-graphic-language">FOUL AND GRAPHIC LANGUAGE</h3>
      <p>
        Please do not use excessive curse words. Additionally, do not use
        graphic sexual or violent language — again, think of our spaces as
        places for people of all ages.
      </p>

      <h2 id="reporting">Reporting</h2>
      <p>
        If you are being harassed by a member of the Bald Bearded Builder
        community, or if you observe someone else being harassed, please report
        the behaviour using our
        <a href="/report/">Code of Conduct Report Form</a>.
      </p>

      <h3 id="thanks">THANKS</h3>
      <p>This code of conduct is hugely inspired by You Got This Conference.</p>
