				<p>
					The Bald Bearded Builder community is filled with amazing, clever
					and creative people, and we're excited for you to join us. Our goal
					is to create spaces where people can gather and discuss important
					themes and feelings that many of us will experience during our
					technical career.
				</p>

				<h2 id="being-a-good-community-member">
					Being a Good Community Member
				</h2>
				<p>
					Yes, there are things we don't want you to do in our community — and
					we'll get to those. But first we'd like to talk about things we do
					want folks to do. These are ways you can be a positive member of the
					Bald Bearded Builder community.
				</p>
				<p>
					Please begin by thinking carefully about and agreeing with the
					following statements:
				</p>

				<ul>
					<li>
						I will be welcoming to everyone at the table, and patient with
						newcomers
					</li>
					<li>I will treat everyone with respect, because they deserve it</li>
					<li>I will be mindful of the needs and boundaries of others</li>
				</ul>

				<p>
					Here are a few other key things you can do to make the community
					great:
				</p>

				<h3 id="be-humble">BE HUMBLE</h3>
				<p>
					People come from all different places, and it's best not to make
					assumptions about what they think or feel. Approach others with
					curiosity. We all have a lot to learn from each other.
				</p>

				<h3 id="be-helpful-when-asked">BE HELPFUL WHEN ASKED</h3>
				<p>
					If someone asks for help, consider jumping in to point them in the
					right direction.
				</p>

				<h3 id="encourage-others">ENCOURAGE OTHERS</h3>
				<p>
					There's no one path to have a career in technology. Instead of
					shooting down other people's ideas, try to engage them in ways that
					create opportunities for learning and fun.
				</p>

				<h2 id="code-of-conduct">Code of Conduct</h2>
				<p>
					We ask everyone who participates in our community upholds their
					ideals. By vowing to follow these guidelines, you will help create a
					welcoming and friendly community based on respect and trust.
				</p>
				<p>
					We are committed to creating a harassment-free community. These
					rules will be strictly enforced in any and all of our official
					spaces, like our Discord server, Twitch chat and physical events,
					and everyone who participates in these spaces is required to agree
					to this community code. We have zero-tolerance for harassment, and
					anybody who engages in the following behaviors may be banned without
					warning. We also ask and expect community members to observe these
					rules anywhere the community is meeting (for example, online chats
					in unofficial platforms or event after-parties).
				</p>

				<h3 id="be-respectful">BE RESPECTFUL</h3>
				<p>
					Don't make offensive comments related to gender, gender identity and
					expression, sexual orientation, disability, mental illness,
					neuro(a)typicality, physical appearance, body size, race,
					immigration status, religion, or other identity markers.
				</p>
				<p>
					Additionally, don't insult or demean others. This includes making
					unwelcome comments about a person's lifestyle choices and practices,
					including things related to diet, health, parenting, drugs, or
					employment. It's not okay to insult or demean others if it's "just a
					joke."
				</p>

				<h3 id="be-welcoming-and-open">BE WELCOMING AND OPEN</h3>
				<p>
					Don't engage in gatekeeping behaviors, like questioning the
					intelligence or knowledge of others as a way to prove their
					credentials. And don't exclude people for prejudicial reasons.
				</p>

				<h3 id="respect-privacy">RESPECT PRIVACY</h3>
				<p>
					Do not publish private communications without consent. Additionally,
					never "out" private aspects of a person's personal identity without
					consent, except as necessary to protect them from intentional abuse.
				</p>

				<h3 id="respect-personal-boundries">RESPECT PERSONAL BOUNDARIES</h3>
				<p>
					Do not introduce gratuitous or off-topic sexual images, languages,
					or behavior in spaces where they are not appropriate. Never make
					physical contact or simulated physical contact without consent or
					after a request to stop. Additionally, do not continue to message
					others about anything if they ask you to stop or leave them alone.
				</p>

				<h3 id="be-a-good-neighbor">BE A GOOD NEIGHBOR</h3>
				<p>
					Do not make threats of violence, intimidate others, incite violence
					or intimidation against others, incite self-harm, stalk, follow, or
					otherwise harass others.
				</p>

				<h2 id="rules-for-online-spaces">Rules for online spaces</h2>
				<p>
					For Bald Bearded Builder' official online spaces, like our Twitch
					chat and community Discord channel, we have some additional rules.
					Any of the following behaviors can result in a ban without warning.
				</p>

				<h3 id="dont-spam">DON'T SPAM</h3>
				<p>Don't spam. We'll ban you.</p>

				<h3 id="keep-it-legal">KEEP IT LEGAL</h3>
				<p>
					If it's illegal, it's not allowed on our websites or in our online
					spaces. Please don't share links to pirated material or other
					nefarious things.
				</p>

				<h3 id="no-trolling">NO TROLLING</h3>
				<p>
					Please be earnest. Don't use excessive sarcasm to annoy or undermine
					other people. And don't bait them with bad faith comments or abuse.
				</p>

				<h3 id="pornography-and-other-nsfw-stuff">
					PORNOGRAPHY AND OTHER NSFW STUFF
				</h3>
				<p>
					Please don't post it or link to it. It doesn't belong in our online
					spaces.
				</p>

				<h3 id="foul-and-graphic-language">FOUL AND GRAPHIC LANGUAGE</h3>
				<p>
					Please do not use excessive curse words. Additionally, do not use
					graphic sexual or violent language — again, think of our spaces as
					places for people of all ages.
				</p>

				<h2 id="reporting">Reporting</h2>
				<p>
					If you are being harassed by a member of the Bald Bearded Builder
					community, or if you observe someone else being harassed, please
					report the behaviour using our
					<a href="/report/">Code of Conduct Report Form</a>.
				</p>

				<h3 id="thanks">THANKS</h3>
				<p>
					This code of conduct is hugely inspired by You Got This Conference.
