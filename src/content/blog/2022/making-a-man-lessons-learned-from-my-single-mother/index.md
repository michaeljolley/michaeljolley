This past year has been full of highs and lows. My kids are doing amazing at
school and are active in music, theater, academic clubs, and cheer. I'm super
fulfilled at work and am genuinely excited about the projects we're working on.

But in July, my mother passed away, two months after her cancer diagnosis. It
was so fast that she never got a chance to fight; no chemotherapy, radiation,
etc. I try to see that as a blessing. She didn't have to struggle.

## A Year of Firsts

I'm in the middle of a year of firsts; the first Thanksgiving/Christmas
without her; the first birthdays without her; the first family vacation without
her. Each milestone brings a tinge of pain as I realize how she would have loved
to have been here.

As Mother's Day has approached (another first,) I've been reflecting on her
life. I feel very fortunate to be her son. She spent my whole life instilling
wisdom, giving guidance, and providing support to many, but especially me.

## Where It Began

> **TRIGGER WARNING:** Physical & emotional abuse.
> 
> Skip to [Hello World](#hello-world) below.

My mom had a very religious upbringing. The church she belonged to was very
legalistic. A "no makeup" and "no jewelry" type of place. But those things
didn't bother her. She loved it and even thrived. She loved people and serving
them. She met my father in church. His grandfather was the pastor. He was
determined to be a minister and she loved the idea of being a minister's wife.

Though she had reservations about his character, they married soon after high
school. Then it was off to the ministry. Pastoring in various states, traveling
as evangelists, and overseeing state youth ministries. From the outside, things
looked great. He was a great preacher and she was an amazing ministry partner.
But she was spending her nights crying herself to sleep.

What people didn't see was the emotional and physical abuse she was enduring.
It's that same old story. He would abuse her and then apologize profusely.
"That will never happen again." But it always did.

During one period, they had a small dog. My dad would yell and the dog would
cower in fear. One night in a fit of rage, he picked up the dog and threw it
against the wall. The dog died.

That's a red flag right!? But her upbringing taught her that divorce was the
worst. In fact, you'd be kicked out of their denomination for it. So even after
years of abuse, and even a separation, she would reconcile and "try to make it
work."

## Hello World

When I came along, my parents had settled back in their hometown. Dad was
selling insurance and mom was a nurse. The physical abuse had stopped, but the
emotional abuse was continuing. 

One night, when I was three years old, I had done something to aggravate my dad.
(I know. It's hard to imagine that I could *ever* get on someone's nerves. 😁)
He was yelling at me and she saw me cower on the couch. It immediately reminded
her of the small dog they had years earlier.

That was the straw that broke the camel's back. She immediately told him to
leave and filed for divorce. Surprisingly, my dad made the divorce process very
easy. He agreed that she could have everything except for a few pieces of
furniture and his clothes; the house, the car, all of it. `This should have
been another red flag. 🚩`

The week after the divorce was signed, the car was repossessed. The mortgage
company called to start foreclosure because the mortgage was three months
behind. People started showing up at the door requesting payment for work on the
house that had never been paid.

## You're Only Responsible for You

Mom often told me "you aren't responsible for the words and actions of others.
But you are responsible for your response, and your words and actions." Looking
back today, I realize she was teaching me that lesson with a lot more than her
words.

When everything seemed to be collapsing in on her, rather than admit defeat, she
buckled down and got a second job. She was working 4 ten-hour shifts at a
hospital Monday through Thursday, then would work 3 twelve-hour shifts Friday
through Sunday at a different hospital. **She was working two full-time jobs.
One as a cardiac ICU nurse.**

> You aren't responsible for the words and actions of others. But you are
responsible for your response, and your words and actions.

I'm proud to say that she lived in that same house until 10 years ago when she
sold it. She paid back every single creditor. Once everyone had been paid, she
left the weekend job. But she didn't stop there.

She started taking night classes at college and, for a few years, I only saw her
on weekends and any weeknights she didn't have class. All until she graduated
with a Bachelors in Health Administration. For me, they were hard years, but
looking back, her determination to succeed and provide for the both of us are
all I remember. 

## Lead by Example

When I was younger, I was a apart of a Scouts-like organization. I loved it and
became a leader early on. I remember one of the first camp-outs we were about to
go on where I was responsible for a "patrol" of 5 boys. One part of my
responsibilities was assigning jobs around the campsite to each of my patrol
members. Certain jobs were "cool," like fire duty. Others were the worst, like
"dish washing." Each persons job would change daily so everyone got to do it
all.

I remember being proud as I showed her my assignments before we left. I had
ranked all jobs from worst to best and scheduled myself for the jobs in that
order. So Day 1, I was washing dishes and by the last day I was taking care of
the fire. She was proud that I had apparently taken to heart her words to
"never ask someone to do a job you aren't willing to do. Lead by example."

Until my late teenage years, she was the Director of Nursing at various nursing
homes, managing hundreds of nurses. Here in Birmingham, even the hint of snow
sends people into a frenzy. Roads are closed with the slightest freeze. So
whenever the roads were likely to close, she would load us up and drive to the
nursing home. I'd spend my "snow days" on a nursing home unit filled with people
fighting dementia and Alzheimers.

> Never ask someone to do a job you aren't willing to do. Lead by example.

She didn't necessarily *have* to be there, but she wanted to set an example. If
the snow was bad and people were stuck at work, they would need to continue
doing their job (possibly 24/7) to take care of the patients. She wasn't about
to ask anyone to do that without them seeing her at their side doing it as well.
