> Geppetto's Guide to Living Puppets

It all started with a colon and parenthesis. That simple smiley face brought us emojis 
and then animojis. What if we could bring those digital representations of our tone & 
sentiment to life in the real world? Join us as we learn from Geppetto's Guide to 
Living Puppets and build an animatronic puppet that mimics our movements using the 
Vonage Video API, Azure Functions, Particle IoT devices and yes, an animatronic puppet.
