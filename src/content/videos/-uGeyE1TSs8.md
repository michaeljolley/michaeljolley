Do you get lost in the number of instances of VS Code you have open? Me too! Peacock solves that by allowing you to change the color of your title bar, status bar and more for each workspace.  Now I can tell which window is my API and which is my front-end. Plus, it integrates with other extensions to provide even more context. In this video we demo some amazing features and discuss the customization options available.
