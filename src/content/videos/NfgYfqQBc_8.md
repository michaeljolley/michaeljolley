Markdown is super useful for documentation, notes and GitHub issues or pull requests, but formatting it correctly can be a pain. markdownlint aims to solve that problem for us by linting, and providing auto-correction, for all of our markdown. Plus, we can save our linting preferences with our code so others can use the same formatting rules.
